# RCP_4.5-8.5
*********Plotting precipitation anomalies in different climate scenarios*******

This code plots precipitation anomalies predicted by an ensemble of global climate models
There are two parts of these codes

#RCP4.5 
It plots the climate predictions in the RCP 4.5 scenario. Takes a set of outputs from different models in the ensemble and plots it on a single graph.
It does so by taking mean of alll the models for a single year.

#RCP8.5
Same for the RCP 8.5 scenario.
